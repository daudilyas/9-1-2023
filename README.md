## Todays work 
Today, I received a lot of notifications about the people who have applied for the job I posted on LinkedIn. I shared this information with my coworker, and we discussed how to create a shortlist of candidates. Additionally, I earned some badges on Microsoft.

Tomorrow, I plan to reach out to the individuals who have applied for the job and inquire about their availability for interviews.
